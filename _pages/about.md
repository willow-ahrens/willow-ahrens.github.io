As a computer science graduate student advised by [Saman Amarasinghe](https://people.csail.mit.edu/saman/), I write algorithms to automatically specialize sparse or
structured tensor computations to particular inputs or architectures. I'm excited
about autotuning approaches and the algorithms that enable them. I strive to bridge the gap between heuristic approaches and theoretical guarantees. My work is listed on my [publications](/publications/) page. I'm incredibly grateful to be supported by a Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship.

Glassblowing adds balance to my life. I blow glass and teach first-time glassblowers at the [MIT Glass Lab](https://glasslab.scripts.mit.edu/). If you're curious, I've highlighted some of my favorite creations in my [portfolio](/portfolio/).
