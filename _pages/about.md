I am a computer science graduate student at MIT advised by [Saman Amarasinghe](https://people.csail.mit.edu/saman/), and graduating soon! I am inspired to make programming high-performance computers more productive, efficient, and accessible.  My research primarily focuses on using compilers to adapt programs to the structure of data, bridging the gap between program flexibility and data structure flexibility. I'm the author of the [Finch](https://github.com/willow-ahrens/Finch.jl) array programming language, which supports a wide variety of programming constructs on sparse, run-length-encoded, banded, or otherwise structured arrays. I also write algorithms to automatically analyze and optimize array programs. My work is listed on my [publications](/publications/) page. I'm incredibly grateful to have been supported by a Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship.

Glassblowing adds balance to my life. I blow glass and teach first-time glassblowers at the [MIT Glass Lab](https://glasslab.scripts.mit.edu/). If you're curious, I've highlighted some of my favorite creations in my [portfolio](/portfolio/).
