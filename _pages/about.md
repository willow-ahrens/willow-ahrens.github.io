title: "About"
---
I am a postdoc at MIT advised by [Saman Amarasinghe](https://people.csail.mit.edu/saman/), and an incoming professor at Georgia Tech! I am inspired to make programming high-performance computers more productive, efficient, and accessible.  My research primarily focuses on using compilers to adapt programs to the structure of data, bridging the gap between program flexibility and data structure flexibility. I'm the author of the [Finch](https://github.com/willow-ahrens/Finch.jl) array programming language, which supports a wide variety of programming constructs on sparse, run-length-encoded, banded, or otherwise structured arrays. I also write algorithms to automatically analyze and optimize array programs. My work is listed on my [publications](/publications/) page. Please reach out if you are interested in doing research at Georgia Tech!

Glassblowing adds balance to my life. I blow glass and teach first-time glassblowers at the [MIT Glass Lab](https://glasslab.scripts.mit.edu/). If you're curious, I've highlighted some of my favorite creations in my [portfolio](/portfolio/).
